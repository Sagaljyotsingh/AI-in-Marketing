In this project, I chose two audios (Audio 1 is a E-commerce customer care call recording, and Audio 2 is Equipment Supply business customer care call recording), and tried to convert them to text using google cloud A.I. services. After converting to text, I ran a sentient analysis on both the texts to observe the trend of sentiment score and sentiment magnitude for both the audios. From the visualization above, it can be seen that both the audios have a positive trend for sentiment score and magnitude, which means that the calls ended on a happy note.
